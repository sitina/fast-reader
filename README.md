I would like to create google chrome plugin, that can take any text (ideally any text from the main text - like the one that is picked when we switch to reader mode).

This plugin would then present the words from this text one by one one at a time and would show them in a quick succession.

The goal of the plugin is to promote fast reading.

When displaying the words, they should not be aligned left, but the plugin would automatically pick one letter in approximately 1/3 of the word, mark that letter by a different color (red, the remaining letters would stay black) and align this word using this single letter.

The plugin also has an option to set the speed of display of words.

Propose the plan and put the implementation steps to this document. Also find any scientific evidence of this "fast reading" technique.
